/**This is where we create a exported const
 * so that we can give an action a reason and understanding
 * whenever we perform an action in the web application.
 * With this you create one when a user is registered, so if
 * you were to look at react in the Redux DevTools you can 
 * see that when a button is clicked the user could have
 * logged in, logged out or a successful registration or etc.
