/**This function is the Login part of the
 * Web application. With this there are
 * a set of variables like the
 * state, propTypes, an action called onSubmit
 * and onChange. Finally there is the render function.
 * Starting with the state: There is the username and
 * password which is neccessary for a user who has registered
 * their account can log into the application.
 *
 * As for propTypes: We have the login feature from the proptype
 * and the IsAuthenticated is used to make sure the user has
 * a proper token
 *
 * The onSubmit action uses the preventDefault premade function to
 * make sure the information in the fields isnt blank
 * then uses the credentials used to login when the button is clicked
 *
 * The onChange is a constantly updated action because in the case
 * that the user changes what is in the fields for username and password
 * it will update the second a change is made.
 *
 * Finally is the Render function, that is what is returned to the
 * web application to allow the system display the form and headers
 * to make the site visually representable.
 *
 *
 * At the bottom is the MapStateToProps this is to control on whether
 * they move on to the next page based on the account created and
 * the token checks out.
